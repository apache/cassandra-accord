/**
 * ConfigurationService is responsible for:
 *  - coordinating linearizable configuration / topology changes across the cluster
 *  - notifying the local node of topology changes
 *  - syncing transaction metadata between replicas on epoch changes
 *  - updating the fast path electorate when appropriate
 *  - acting as a database of previous epoch configurations
 *
 * The high level flow of a topology change is as follows:
 *
 *  - ConfigurationService becomes aware of a new epoch/Topology
 *
 *  - ConfigurationService notifies the node of the new configuration service by calling
 *      {@link accord.api.ConfigurationService.Listener#onTopologyUpdate(accord.topology.Topology)}
 *
 *  - Once the node has setup the new topology, it will call {@link accord.api.ConfigurationService#acknowledgeEpoch(EpochReady)}
 *      which indicates the node will no longer create txnIds for the previous epoch, and it's commits can now be synced
 *      with other replicas.
 *
 *  - ConfigurationService is now expected to begin syncing fast path decisions made in the previous epoch to other
 *      replicas. In the case of a replication change (new replica, ownership movement), the configuration service
 *      needs to notify the new replica of the transaction history of the relevant ranges.
 *
 *  - Once the previous epoch data has been synced to other nodes, the configuration service needs to notify the other
 *      nodes that this node has synced data for the previous epoch.
 *
 *  - ConfigurationService will notify the node when other nodes complete syncing an epoch by calling
 *      {@link accord.api.ConfigurationService.Listener#onRemoteSyncComplete(accord.local.Node.Id, long)}
 *
