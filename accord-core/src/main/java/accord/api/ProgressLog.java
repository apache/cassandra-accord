/**
 * This interface is responsible for managing incomplete transactions *and retrying them*.
 * Each stage is fenced by two methods, one entry and one exit. The entry method notifies the implementation
 * that it should soon be notified of the exit method, and if it is not that it should invoke some
 * pre-specified recovery mechanism.
 *
 * This is a per-CommandStore structure, with transactions primarily being managed by their home shard,
 * except during PreAccept as a transaction may not yet have been durably recorded by the home shard.
 *
 * The basic logical flow for ensuring a transaction is committed and applied at all replicas is as follows:
 *
 *  - First, ensure a quorum of the home shard is aware of the transaction by invoking {@link InformHomeOfTxn}.
 *    Entry by {@link #preaccepted} Non-home shards may now forget this transaction for replay purposes.
 *
 *  - Non-home shards may also be informed of transactions that are blocking the progress of other transactions.
 *    If the {@code waitingOn} transaction that is blocking progress is uncommitted it is required that the progress
 *    log invoke {@link accord.coordinate.FetchData#fetch} for the transaction if no {@link #committed} is witnessed.
 *
 *  - Members of the home shard will be informed of a transaction to monitor by the invocation of {@link #preaccepted} or
 *    {@link #accepted}. If this is not followed closely by {@link #committed}, {@link accord.coordinate.MaybeRecover} should
 *    be invoked.
 *
 *  - Members of the home shard will later be informed that the transaction is {@link #readyToExecute}.
 *    If this is not followed closely by {@link #executed}, {@link accord.coordinate.MaybeRecover} should be invoked.
 *
 *  - Finally, it is up to each shard to independently coordinate disseminating the write to every replica.
