         * A SyncPoint is unique in that it does not agree an executeAt, but instead agrees a precise collection of
         * dependencies that represent a superset of the transactions that have reached consensus to execute before
         * their txnId. This set of dependencies will be made durable in the Accept round, and re-proposed by recovery
         * if the transaction is not fully committed (but was durably accepted).
         *
         * This is only safe because the transaction does not really "execute" and does not order itself with respect to
         * others, it only orders others with respect to itself, so its executeAt can be declared to be its txnId.
         * In effect it represents an inequality relation, rather than a precise point in the transaction log - its
         * dependencies permit saying that we are "after" its point in the log, not that we are *at* that point.
         * This permits us to use the dependencies from the PreAccept round.
         *
         * Note, it would be possible to do a three-round operation that achieved this with a precise "at" position
         * in the log, with a second round between PreAccept and Accept to collect deps < executeAt, if executeAt &gt; txnId,
         * but we do not need this property here.
         *
         * This all ensures the effect of this transaction on invalidation of earlier transactions is durable.
         * This is most useful for ExclusiveSyncPoint.
