/**
 * Defines an inequality point in the processing of the distributed transaction log, which is to say that
 * this is able to say that the point has passed, or that it has not yet passed, but it is unable to
 * guarantee that it is processed at the precise moment given by {@code at}. This is because we do not
 * expect the whole cluster to process these, and we do not want transaction processing to be held up,
 * so while these are processed much like a transaction, they are invisible to real transactions which
 * may proceed before this is witnessed by the node processing it.
