/**
 * The consistency level Accord should use when reading/writing non-Accord data
 * For example when reading non-Accord data it must be read at this CL
 * When read repairing non-Accord data it must be persisted at this CL
 *
 * If a CL other than UNSPECIFIED is requested for write then persistence must also be synchronous
 * so that it is globally visible outside of Accord.
 *
 * A read consistency level other than UNSPECIFIED means that merging of read data needs to perform a real merge
 * and not a per key overwrite that assumes the result for each key is the same.
 *
 * INVALID indicates this is a read of Accord metadata which is mostly for clarity as the correct behavior
 * is inferred in other ways at the moment rather than from this enum value.
