         * have gotten the information you need.
         *
         * ApproveIfQuorum indicates that the current response is not sufficient for this shard, but if a quorum of similar
         * responses are received it will be enough. For data reads a single data response
         * might trigger Approve if the consistency level only requires one data read, or a data read + some number of digest reads if the CL
         * requires it (triggering multiple ApproveIfQuorum and never Approve).
         *
         * For Accord metadata reads it's usually a quorum or getting a response back that meets
         * some sufficiency criteria in which cases more responses from the shard aren't necessary.
         *
         * These two pretty orthogonal concepts (sufficiency vs (data and digest)) are mixed throughout ReadTracker
         * and ReadCoordinator. There are no digest reads for Accord metadata it's really all about sufficiency XOR hitting a quorum,
         * and even when reading data it's not a given that a quorum is required or that there will be digest
         * reads sent since that is based on consistency level.
