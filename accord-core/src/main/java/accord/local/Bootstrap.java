/**
 * Captures state associated with a command store's adoption of a collection of new ranges.
 * There are a number of layers to support sensible retries:
 *
 *  - The outer Bootstrap initiates one initial {@link Attempt}.
 *  - This attempt may fail some portion as it is being processed, and this portion may then be retried
 *    by the node's {@link Agent}. This will create a new {@link Attempt}
 *  - The {@link Attempt} may fail in its entirety, in which case the remaining ranges will get a new {@link Attempt}
 *  - Within each {@link Attempt} we then permit an implementation's coordinator to initiate multiple fetches for the
 *    same range, of which we only require one to succeed, but these must be managed separately as the ranges being
 *    fetched may not be identical.
 *  - Once all ranges have either been bootstrapped or invalidated (because the store no longer owns them)
 *    the promise is completed.
 *
 *   We also support aborting ranges that are no longer owned by the store, which may be passed down to the
 *   FetchCoordinator (or other implementation-defined coordinator).
 *
 * 
 *
 * Important callback points:
 *   - Bootstrap.Attempt.starting()
 *       Invoked by system/impl, indicating we have sought a snapshot on a remote replica
 *   - FetchRange.started()
 *       Invoked by system/impl, indicating we have bound a snapshot on a remote replica and are fetching its contents
 *   - FetchRange.cancel()
 *       Invoked by system/impl, indicating we have failed an attempt to bind a snapshot on a remote replica.
 *   - Bootstrap.Attempt.invalidate()
 *       We no longer trying to fetch these ranges (perhaps because no longer own them)
 *   - Bootstrap.Attempt.maybeComplete
 *      - Invoked whenever we have finished fetching a range
