/**
 * Helper methods and classes to invoke coordination to propagate information about durability.
 *
 * Both CoordinateShardDurable and CoordinateGloballyDurable use wall time to loosely coordinate between nodes
 * so that they take non-overlapping (hopefully) turns doing the coordination.
 *
 * Both of these have a concept of rounds where rounds have a known duration in wall time, and the current round is known
 * based on time since the epoch, and the point in time where a node should do something in a given round is known based
 * on its index in the sorted list of nodes ids in the current epoch.
 *
 * Coordinate globally durable is simpler because they just need to take turns so nodes just calculate when it is their
 * turn and invoke CoordinateGloballyDurable.
 *
 * CoordinateShardDurable needs nodes to not overlap on the ranges they operate on or the exlusive sync points overlap
 * with each other and block progress. A target duration to process the entire ring is set, and then each node in the
 * current round has a time in the round that it should start processing, and the time it starts and the subranges it is
 * responsible for rotates backwards every round so that a down node doesn't prevent a subrange from being processed.
 *
 * The work for CoordinateShardDurable is further subdivided where each subrange a node operates on is divided a fixed
 * number of times and then processed one at a time with a fixed wait between them.
 *
 * TODO (expected): cap number of coordinations we can have in flight at once
 * TODO (expected): do not start new ExclusiveSyncPoint if we have more than X already agreed and not yet applied
 * Didn't go with recurring because it doesn't play well with async execution of these tasks
